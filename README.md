What to do
------------
* piezo driver, not an in class exercise
	* warnings to people in vicinity (norm_mode, every 2 seconds)
	* warn rider too fast (ovr_spd,alarming)
	* battery low warnings (threshold is 0x800), able to occur same time as too fast warning
	* range = 300 Hz --> 7 kHz 
* synthesis
* A2D Interface (DETAILS IN misc things to do)
	* need a way to specify left and right load cell readings (and perhaps battery too) and have those translate into something that is accessed by your A2D_Intf block (SPI bus).
	* modify ADC128S or augment SPI_ADC128S to create such a block that can be used as part of fullchip testing.
	* What needs to drive nxt into A2D_Intf to force it to perform round robin readings? Really just any
periodic signal that happens often enough but not too often. Hey, donâ€™t we get vld readings from the
inertial sensor 200+ times a second.

* flesh out Segway.v
* flesh out SegwayModel.sv
* optional Segway_tb.v
