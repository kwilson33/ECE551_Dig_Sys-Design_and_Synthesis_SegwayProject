What is done
------------
* Module instantiations in Segway.v
* Balance control
* Steer_en


What to do
------------
* Inertial integrator/ Inertial Interface : 
	* Verify waveform
	* Should we use don't cares for the read values?
* piezo
* synthesis
* A2D Interface (DETAILS IN misc things to do)
	* need a way to specify left and right load cell readings (and perhaps battery too) and have those translate into something that is accessed by your A2D_Intf block (SPI bus).
	* modify ADC128S or augment SPI_ADC128S to create such a block that can be used as part of fullchip testing.
	* What needs to drive nxt into A2D_Intf to force it to perform round robin readings? Really just any
periodic signal that happens often enough but not too often. Hey, donâ€™t we get vld readings from the
inertial sensor 200+ times a second.

* Complete Segway_tb.v
